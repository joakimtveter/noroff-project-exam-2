This is my submission for the second year project exam in the [Noroff Frontend Development](https://www.noroff.no/en/studies/vocational-school/front-end-development) course.

## Description

### Brief

The brief for this project was to create a website for a fictional AirBnB site called Holidaze.
The API was provided by Noroff.

### Technology stack

I have used the following technologies in this project:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as the programming language
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the build tool
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) as the UI library
- [React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/) for client-side routing
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for form state and handling
- [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) for form validation
- [Redux Toolkit & RTK Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/) as the Component Library
- [React Toastify](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction/) for displaying messages

## Development

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.
Developed on Node.js version 18, older or newer versions have not beem tested.
This project contains an `.nvmrc`-file. If you use nvm, you can run `nvm use` to switch to the correct version.

### Up and running

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` from inside the project folder to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

The main branch is protected, so you will need to create a new branch and open a pull request to merge your changes.

## Deployment

The site is hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com/). Any commit to the `main` branch will trigger a deployment.
The site can be found at [https://pe2.tveter.dev/](https://pe2.tveter.dev/).

## Contributing

Here you can detail any information you want to provide regarding contributing to the project. For big projects you will usually have a separate `CONTRIBUTING.md` and link to it, but for smaller projects you can simply include instructions here. These instructions can simply detail the process you want a person to take, such as to make sure to open a pull request so code can be reviewed.
