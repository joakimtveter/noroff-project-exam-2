# Noroff - Project Exam 2 - Holidaze

This is my submission for the second year project exam in the Noroff Frontend Development course.

## Development

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.
Developed on Node.js version 18, older or newer versions have not beem tested.
If you use nvm, you can run `nvm use` to switch to the correct version.

### Up and running

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`

## Deployment

Any commit to the `main` branch will trigger a deployment to [Netlify](https://netlify.com/).
The main branch is protected, so you will need to create a new branch and open a pull request to merge your changes.
