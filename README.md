## Development

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.
Developed on Node.js version 18, older or newer versions have not beem tested.
This project contains an `.nvmrc`-file. If you use nvm, you can run `nvm use` to switch to the correct version.

### Up and running

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` from inside the project folder to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

The main branch is protected, so you will need to create a new branch and open a pull request to merge your changes.

## Deployment

The site is hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com/). Any commit to the `main` branch will trigger a deployment.
The site can be found at [https://pe2.tveter.dev/](https://pe2.tveter.dev/).
