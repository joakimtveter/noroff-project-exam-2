# Noroff - Project Exam 2 - Holidaze

This is my submission for the second year project exam in the Noroff Frontend Development course.

## Description

### Brief

The brief for this project was to create a website for a fictional AirBnB site called Holidaze.
The API was provided by Noroff.

### Technology stack

I have used the following technologies in this project:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as the programming language
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the build tool
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) as the UI library
- [React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/) for client-side routing
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for form state and handling
- [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) for form validation
- [Redux Toolkit & RTK Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- CSS Modules
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/) for the Calendar component

## Development

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.
Developed on Node.js version 18, older or newer versions have not beem tested.
If you use nvm, you can run `nvm use` to switch to the correct version.

### Up and running

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`

## Deployment

Any commit to the `main` branch will trigger a deployment to [Netlify](https://netlify.com/).
The main branch is protected, so you will need to create a new branch and open a pull request to merge your changes.
